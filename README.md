# muzero_sketch

This is a simplisitc and naive sketch of how you might be able to apply a MuZero like approach to a llama shaped LLM

This will not work as written, probably doesn't compile and does not account for a majority of the complexity involved with impelmenting this soltiuon in practice (finding the appropriate branching hyperparams, selecting an appropriate reward function, etc).

Will review all PRs and Issues but probably wont merge or address any of them (sorry ❤️)
